## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This lab should be completed in pairs or trios._

In this lab, you will be practicing the Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort algorithms.

## Exercise

This lab will be split up into two sections: the practice and the interview sections.

**Practice: 45 minutes**

Below, you will find a handful of number arrays. By hand, sort as many as you can *with your partner(s)*. For the ones you sort, use both the Bubble and Insertion sorts. Make sure to show your work; show the result after each pass.

> 8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 0, 9

> 10, 9, 8, 7, 6

> -4, 6, 33, 12, 1, 1, -1

> 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, -2

> 12

*Bonus:*

> I, r, o, n, M, a, n

**Interview: 20 - 30 minutes**

Just like today's morning exercise, one person will play the interviewee, and the others will play the interviewer(s). The interviewers will give the interviewee an array of numbers. The interviewee has 10 minutes to sort the numbers via Insert sort. After 10 minutes, the team swaps. Repeat until everyone has gone.

#### Requirements

Provide the results from the practice. You can either take photos of the individual results or you can type them in a text file; it does not matter which one.

#### Deliverable

A file or photos detailing all of the results of the practice. Nothing to submit for the interview section.
